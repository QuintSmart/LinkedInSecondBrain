# About my usage of Fleeting Notes, Permanent notes and Literature Notes
## Fleeting notes
A ==fleeting note is using for highly temporary notes== that one will like trash later. They should be just pointers for following up information, maybe also ToDo lists, more noise level information. 
Fire and forget would be just fine on this level.

Use [[TPL Fleeting Note]] and best using the command to create a fleeting note from a template.

### Storing fleeting notes
Fleeting notes are tagged with #type/fleeting-note

Fleeting notes reside in a folder *fleeting notes* that resides inside a Zettelkasten folder place area for each space [[S01 LinkedIn/030-039 Areas/32 Zettelkasten/Fleeting Notes/Fleeting Notes]]

## Permanent notes
Permanent notes will form the building blocks/lego bricks for my Second Brain.  They should be on ==higher quality level==. 

There is a transition from literature notes and derived permanent notes. And there is also a transition from fleeting notes to permanent notes and also to literature notes.

Use [[TPL Permanent Note]] and best using the command to create a permanent note from a template.

### Storing permanent notes
Permanent notes are tagged with #type/permanent-note

Place them in Permanent notes folder when they don't have an obvious area to reside in. In an area when they have a strong connect to that area of responsibility.

#### Permanent notes in Projects
What should happen when I archive a project? 
I guess I should scan for permanent notes from that project that are worth keeping in areas. 

How should I handle permanent notes that belong to several projects?
+ Check if it makes sense to move them to an areas
+ I should avoid duplicating that knowledge artefact
+ In beginning I can just link/embed notes in the relevant context and closely monitor the need for extraction. 

## Literature notes
Use [[TPL Literature Note]] and best using the command to create a literature note from a template.

### Storing of Literature notes
Literature notes are tagged with #type/literature-note 

There are different entry points for literature notes but all will stored in [[Literature Notes]]

+ [[Literature Inbox]] contain the [[_Reading Order]] Kanban board and book notes created from the *Book search* plugin
+ [[Kindle]] contains all Kindle book highlights by Kindle title. The obsidian *Kindle* plugin connects to my Amazon account. In Kindle I already do first stage highlighting while reading a book.

## Index notes
An index note marks note that act as entry point to find other notes. Or like Maps of Content provide a high level intro about a topic and provide possibilities to drill down.

### Storing of index notes
Index notes are tagged with #type/index-note.

Maps of Content are a sub type of Index notes.


## Examples for using the different note types
+ When I read a book, Bib or article and want to capture highlights - these are initially literature notes. They stem from various sources like:
	+ books on Kindle
	+ articles in Matter
	+ bibs in Blinkist
	+ pdfs/eBooks from other sources
+ When I want to capture a fast thought that I want to process later, then this should become a fleeting note (best also linked for later usage with my journal)
+ When I *distill* information from a literature note I create *knowledge artefacts* that become permanent notes. In the beginning this permanent note is still in an early stage (see [[Maturity Model for Notes]])
+ Is a book note already a literature note? Yes, when I created the books note  snippet from the Obsidian book note plugin. No when it is just a thought and I did not yet have time to create a note with more details from it.

## Working with note maturity levels
I apply my [[Maturity Model for Notes| maturity levels ]] to my permanent notes. 

#### Should I also work with maturity levels for my literature notes?
+ Dimensions might have similar names but transition criteria will be different. And maybe it would be even better to have an own naming convention here. For now I'll use the same maturity system
