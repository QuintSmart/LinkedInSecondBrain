## Create a new note
Let's **create your first new note** and immediately apply the format of a fleeting note. In order to do that click on the following link and from the dialog choose *TPL Fleeting note*.

+ [Create new file from Template](obsidian://advanced-uri?filepath=S01%2520Personal%252F100-199%2520Projects%252F110%2520Building%2520a%2520Second%2520Brain%2520with%2520Obsidian%252F30-39%2520Areas%252Faction%2520driven%2520learning%252Fweek%25201%252FCreate%2520a%2520Journal%2520entry%2520for%2520today%2520and%2520link%2520with%2520first%2520learning.md&commandid=templater-obsidian%253Acreate-new-note-from-template&openmode=split)

Now please rename the note to *What is a fleeting note*. (your can do that with the menu right top ... and *rename* or by clicking in the title on top of the window or *Command* + P - Rename file in the newly created note).

## Edit your newly created note
Please add your own thoughts in [[What is a fleeting note]].

You can follow for example these two leading questions:
+ What are immediate candidates for Fleeting notes that come to your mind?
+ How might adding fleeting notes to your Second Brain help?

## Locate your newly created note
+ with *Control* + *F* inside your newly created notes you can locate a note in the Obsidian Folder structure. 
	+ the following link behaves like clicking Control + F your newly created file [Reveal *What is a fleeting note* in Obsidian Folder Structure](obsidian://advanced-uri?filepath=S01%2520Personal%252F030-039%2520Areas%252F32%2520Zettelkasten%252FFleeting%2520Notes%252FWhat%2520is%2520a%2520fleeting%2520note.md&commandid=file-explorer%253Areveal-active-file&openmode=split)

Did you notice that your note [[What is a fleeting note]] is located in the folder [[S01 LinkedIn/030-039 Areas/32 Zettelkasten/Fleeting Notes/Fleeting Notes| Fleeting Notes]] although you did not move it there? This is done when you apply the *Fleeting note template* to a note. 

## Create a new Journal note for today and link it with your fleeting note
Now let's create your first Journal note. Using journalling you can capture daily insights. I use it to reflect on my day and also to link to all topics I touched during that day in My Second brain. 

When you link your created or revised notes in your journal you keep a little of the original context when the note was used. Over time you can use that to remember better what a note is about and in what context you created that note and maybe further notes.

I usually create my daily note either by clicking on  ![[Pasted image 20230219163300.png|50]] or via clicking on the calendar day (right top) [Open Calendar view](obsidian://advanced-uri?commandid=calendar%253Ashow-calendar-view&openmode=split)
Or click the link [create your first daily note](obsidian://advanced-uri?daily=true&openmode=split)

You should now see a new note in a new window right to this note. 

### Link the daily note with What is a fleeting note
In the section *My 3 permanent notes today* you can now link the new note [[What is a fleeting note]]. 

You can do these for example following one of these 3 ways:
+ [Open recent files view](obsidian://advanced-uri?commandid=recent-files-obsidian%253Arecent-files-open) (shows a small window left top) and drag & drop the entry *What is a fleeting note* to your daily note on the right
+ Edit the daily note and insert the Link [[What is a fleeting note]]
+ Edit the daily note and do a file search + insert

## Study your Obsidian Graph
[Open your local graph](obsidian://advanced-uri?filepath=S01%2520Personal%252F030-039%2520Areas%252F32%2520Zettelkasten%252FFleeting%2520Notes%252FWhat%2520is%2520a%2520fleeting%2520note.md&commandid=graph%253Aopen-local&openmode=split) . Can you see your [[What is a fleeting note]]? By the way the same window is also display in your right window side.

In case you want to have a look on all notes and their linking have fun exploring this [overall Obsidian graph view](obsidian://advanced-uri?commandid=graph%253Aopen&openmode=popover).
