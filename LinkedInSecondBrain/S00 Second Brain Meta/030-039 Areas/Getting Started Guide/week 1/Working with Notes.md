In order to take notes in Obsidian you need to understand the simple syntax  of Markdown to apply basic formatting like **bold**, *italic*, lists, paragraphs, links and more.

The following two great guides help you to understand *Markdown* quick and easy. I recommend to read the guide and immediately experiment. You find some tasks below, where you can apply your learnings already.
