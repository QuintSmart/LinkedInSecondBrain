## Embrace your quirks
  
+ That weird hobby? Talk about it.  
+ Your unpopular opinion? Share it.  
+ Your raw emotions? Embrace them.  
  
## Use your voice  
  
+ Write like you speak.  
+ Ditch corporate jargon.  
+ Pay attention to your tone.  
  
## Share stories

* Take people on a journey.  
* Leverage your experiences.  
* People remember stories, not facts.  
  
## Take a stance

+ Don't sit on the fence.  
+ Have opinions (even if they're unpopular).  
  
## Show your face

+ Get comfortable on camera.  
+ People connect with faces, not logos.
