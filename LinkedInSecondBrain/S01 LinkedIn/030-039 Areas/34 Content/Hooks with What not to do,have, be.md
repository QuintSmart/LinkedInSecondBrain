[Source by Ryan Keeler](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mrryankeeler_stop-wasting-your-time-on-complex-strategies-activity-7241701295336665089-LUZs?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

## Tell them what they DON'T need to do:  
  
↳ “Skip the endless networking events”  
↳ "Without working 80-hour weeks"  
↳ “Forget about cold calling”  
↳ “Minimal effort required”  
↳ “Stop wasting your time”  
  
## Tell them what they DON'T need to have:  
  
↳ “Without a professional studio setup”  
↳ "No need for an army of assistants"  
↳ "A large ad budget isn't essential”  
↳ "No massive budget required"  
  
## Tell them what they DON'T need to be:  
  
↳ “This works even if you're not a smooth talker”  
↳ “Success isn't reserved for the tech-savvy”  
↳ “Not an extrovert? No problem”  
↳ "Even if your not a tech genius"  
↳ “Without being an extrovert”  
  
See what these do?  
  
They eliminate three major objections.  
Before your audience could even think of them.  
  
This technique:  
  
• Builds trust fast.  
• Grabs attention in an instant.  
• Keeps people engaged for longer.  
  
But why is this?  
Why does it work so well?  
  
Because you're addressing their fears head-on.  
  
You're showing you care, you’re saying,  
**"I get you. I understand your worries."**
