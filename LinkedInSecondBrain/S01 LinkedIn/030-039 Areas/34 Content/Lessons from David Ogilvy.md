[Source](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/josephpatchell_ive-spent-11-hours-studying-david-ogilvy-activity-7222947623337349120-ECyW?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Here are 5 powerful lessons I learnt:  
  
(to help you grow on LI)  
  
## Research obsessively.  
  
Always research your product, audience, and competitors.  
  
↳ E.g. Ogilvy spent 3 weeks reading about Rolls-Royce before writing his ad.  
  
How to apply it:  
  
→ Study the top 0.001%.  
  
I’ve spent hundreds of hours studying LinkedIn creators.  
  
↳ Pick 2-5 LinkedIn creators.  
↳ Analyse posts with Kleo.  
↳ Emulate, iterate, refine.  
  
## Write magnetic headlines.  
  
Headlines should capture attention and reader interest.  
  
↳ E.g. Ogilvy's iconic ad copy conveys this: "At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock."  
  
How to apply it:  
  
→ Nail the hook (and sub-hook).  
  
I write “I” in my hooks for credibility, and use numbers for attention.  
  
↳ Keep hooks under 50 characters.  
↳ Use sub-hooks with brackets.  
↳ Promise value in the post.  
  
## Focus on benefits, not features.  
  
Highlighting benefits stimulates buying incentive, while focusing on features can detract from it.  
  
↳ E.g. Write "whiter teeth" instead of "contains fluoride".  
  
How to apply it:  
  
→ Write ‘how I’ posts.  
  
E.g. My post - “How I got 86,884 impressions in 14 days”.  
  
↳ Provide step by step tips.  
↳ Give strategies & tactics.  
↳ Be 100% transparent.  
  
## Make specific claims.  
  
Use accurate facts and figures to build credibility and trust.  
  
↳ E.g. For example, write "Dove soap is one-quarter moisturizing cream" instead of "Dove is moisturizing".  
  
How to apply it:  
  
→ Share your ‘receipts’.  
  
I share screenshots of my analytics in most pinned comments.  
  
↳ Focus on the 'right' metrics.  
↳ Hard numbers work well.  
↳ It increases credibility.  
  
## Use simple language.  
  
Good copy is built on clear, conversational language.  
  
↳ E.g. Ogilvy said "If you're trying to persuade people to do something, or buy something, it seems to me you should use their language."  
  
How to apply it:  
  
→ Keep your posts informal and real.
