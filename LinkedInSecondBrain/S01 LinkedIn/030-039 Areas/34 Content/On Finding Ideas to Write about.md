âœ¨ Grab a blank paper, a gel pen;  
  
+  And first write down a problem people face in your sector/niche.  
+ Write down the valid precautions people can take to avoid it.  
+ Write down your POVs on why such a problem occurs.  
+ Now write detailed solutions for this very problem.  
+ And, keep repeating for other problems too.
