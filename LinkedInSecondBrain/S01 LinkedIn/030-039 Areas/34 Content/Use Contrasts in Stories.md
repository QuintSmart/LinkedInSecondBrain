# Use Contrasts in Stories
[Source Niall Ratcliffe](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/niall-ratcliffe_this-story-racked-up-458000-views-for-me-activity-7221136949728735232-6_wH?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

1/ In The Hook  
  
- I start with a relatable bad situation.  
- Drill it home through repetition.  
- Then contrast with “Life today”.  
  
💡 People read on to learn how I went from bad → good.  
  
——  
  
2/ In The Re-Hook  
  
- I highlight a common notion.  
↳ That people say “Anyone can do it”  
  
- Argue the complete opposite.  
↳ Saying “It’s been a sh*t show”  
  
- Which sets up the story.  
↳ People are curious to read on.  
  
💡 This deepens the “hook” I have on the reader.  
  
——  
  
3/ Dated Signposts  
  
- I use signposts to give a timeline.  
- “4 years ago” as a start line.  
- “Today” as a finish line.  
  
💡 This shows people I went from X → Y in just 4 years.
