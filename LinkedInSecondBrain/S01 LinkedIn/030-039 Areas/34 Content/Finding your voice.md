# Finding your voice
[Source Ryan Keeler](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mrryankeeler_i-dont-know-my-tone-of-voice-yes-you-activity-7259473265729929217-mIJ2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)


You might not see it yet,  
but your tone of voice is already inside of you.  
  
Just think about:  
  
â€¢ How you speak to others.  
â€¢ How you text to your family.  
â€¢ Your conversations with friends.  
  
Is the way you approach these:  
  
â€¢ Professional?  
â€¢ sarcastic?  
â€¢ Funny?  
â€¢ Sassy?  
  
See what I mean? - It's in there.  
  
So if you're struggling to reveal it,  
focus on these 2 key steps:  
  
Think about your own personality:  
  
â€¢ How do you emphasise things?  
â€¢ What makes you unique?  
â€¢ What are your quirks?  
  
Then, think about your ideal clients:  
  
â€¢ How can you resonate with them?  
â€¢ How do they communicate?  
â€¢ Where are they struggling?  
â€¢ What do they respond to?  
â€¢ What are their needs?  
  
Combine those two,  
and you've found your tone of voice.  
  
But rememberâ€¦  
  
It's not about being perfect or rigid.  
  
It's about being yourself,  
and connecting in a way that only you can.  
  
P.S. How do you define your tone of voice?
