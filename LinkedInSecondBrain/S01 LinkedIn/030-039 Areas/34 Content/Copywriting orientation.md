Traditional copywriting rules don’t apply on LinkedIn:  
  
(People want to feel like they’re talking to a friend.)  
  
9 in 10 people struggle to create engaging content on LinkedIn.  
  
Here’s how to stand out:  
  
1. Conversational Tone:  
  
↳ On LinkedIn, a conversational tone works better than formal writing.  
↳ People want to feel like they’re talking to a friend, not reading a textbook.  
  
2. Storytelling:  
  
↳ Telling a story grabs attention and keeps readers engaged.  
↳ Share your experiences, successes, and failures to connect on a personal level.  
  
3. Value Over Sales:  
  
↳ LinkedIn users prefer value-driven content over sales pitches.  
↳ Focus on providing insights, tips, and useful information rather than pushing products or services.  
  
4. Authenticity:  
  
↳ Being genuine and authentic resonates more with the LinkedIn audience.  
↳ Share real stories, struggles, and successes to build trust and credibility.  
  
5. Engagement:  
  
↳ Encourage interaction by asking for opinions and starting conversations.  
↳ Engaging with your audience builds relationships and increases visibility.  
  
6. Visuals:  
  
↳ Use images, videos, and infographics to make your posts more appealing.  
↳ Visual content stands out in the feed and can convey messages more effectively.  
  
7. Brevity:  
  
↳ Keep your posts concise and to the point.  
↳ Long-winded posts can lose readers’ interest quickly.  
  
8. Professionalism:  
  
↳ While being conversational, maintain a level of professionalism.  
↳ Avoid slang and overly casual language to keep your credibility.  
  
9. Consistency:  
  
↳ Post regularly to stay top of mind with your connections.  
↳ Consistency helps in building a loyal audience who looks forward to your content.  
  
10. Personal Branding:  
  
↳ Focus on building your personal brand.  
↳ Share your expertise, insights, and unique perspective to stand out in your industry.
