# Insight on Hook and Re-Hook

[Source by Madhesh Senthilvel](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/madheshs_ive-written-140-linkedin-posts-in-the-past-activity-7240563990131589120-Yoh3?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Combining all the data, I devised a method of writing good hooks (that take less than 2 mins, without AI).  
  
Here you go:  
  
→ Write the body of the post (without the hook).  
→ Summarize your entire post's value in 1-2 lines.  
→ Turn those value lines into a single bold statement.  
→ Rehook using opposing words like "but","though", etc.  
  
Here's how it looks in practice.  
  
Example hook:  
  
"Making money online is simple.  
  
(But that doesn't mean it's easy.)"  
  
Post Value → Making money online isn't complicated.  
Post - Hook → Making money online is simple.  
Re-hook → (But that doesn't mean it's easy.)  
  
"How can something be simple and hard at once?"
