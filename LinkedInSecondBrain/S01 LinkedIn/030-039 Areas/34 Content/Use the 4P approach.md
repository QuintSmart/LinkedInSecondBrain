## Promise
  
The letter **promised valuable knowledge** from the Wall Street Journal. It suggested that reading the Journal could make the difference between being a company president and a department manager.  
  
## Picture  
  
The letter **painted a vivid picture. It told a story** of two college classmates. One became a company president, the other a department manager. This helped readers see the possible outcomes of their careers.  
  
## Proof
  
The letter **provided proof of the Journal's value**. It positioned the Journal as "the country's only national business daily." It described its comprehensive coverage of business news, consumer insights, and investing guides. It implied that successful business leaders rely on the Journal.  
  
## Push
  
The letter included **strong calls to action**. It offered various subscription options and trials. Language like "Try our product for a month, and then decide" reduced risk. It directed readers to fill out the enclosed order card and mail it in.
