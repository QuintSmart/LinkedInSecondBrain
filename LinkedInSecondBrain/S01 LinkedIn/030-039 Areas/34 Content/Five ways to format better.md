## Hooks  
  
Use only 1 line to write every hook  
Don’t lead with negativity in your hook  
Curiosity and desire is what you’re aiming for  
  
  
## Lists  
  
1. Use lists to summarize steps  
2. Write each point as one line only  
3. Don't add any spaces between lines  
4. Use numbers makes it easier to read  
5. Try to format the list by length of sentences  
  
  
## Listicles with examples  
  
1. The first line in every item is your main point  
↳ "The second line should be an example"  
  
  
## Paragraphs  
  
Try to use short sentences that fit in 1 line.  
Try to make paragraphs shorter than 3 lines.  
If it’s not a numbered list, keep it under 3 lines.  
  
  
## Summary/Closing statements  
  
Make your summary less than 3 lines.  
↳ Ideally, write just 1 line.
