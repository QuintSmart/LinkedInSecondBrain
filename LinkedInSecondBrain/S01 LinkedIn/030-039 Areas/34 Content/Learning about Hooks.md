## 12 hints from Lara Acosta
[Lara Acosta](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laraacostar/)
1) Use **specific numbers** to gain trust  
2) Keep the **hook between 7-10 words**  
3) Reveal the final outcome in the hook  
4) **==Always deliver on the hooks promise==**  
5) Use the **first line to make a statement**  
6) And use the **second line to add context**  
7) Use curiosity to get them to "see more"  
8) Give them a benefit or immediate result  
9) Use transformations for emotional connection  
10) Keep it concise by focusing on **one simple idea**  
11) Use parenthesis to highlight a desired outcome  
12) Repeat using **"you", "your", "How I" and "How you"**
