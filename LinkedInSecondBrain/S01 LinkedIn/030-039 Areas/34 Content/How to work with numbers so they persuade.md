# How to work with numbers so they persuade
[Source Sheza Yazdani](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sheza-yazdani_socialemediamarketing-personalbranding-socialsheza-activity-7241762154985512962-L3iZ?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

Data doesn't persuade.  
Stories do.
  
## Shock value:  
  
↳ Don't say "50% increase."  
↳ Say "Half your audience is invisible to you."  
  
(It personalizes the statistic, making it emotionally impactful)  
  
## Micro-stories:  
  
↳ Avoid: "I've ghostwritten for 100 CEOs."  
↳ Try: "100 CEOs have shared their voice through my words."  
  
(It shifts focus from you to the impact, creating intrigue)  
  
## Unexpected comparisons:  
  
↳ Avoid: "My clients save 5 hours/week on content creation."  
↳ Write: "My clients gain back 32 working days a year for strategic thinking."  
  
(It reframes the benefit in a more striking, relatable way.)  
  
## The rule of one:  
  
↳ Avoid multiple stats in a single line.  
  
e.g. "Increased followers by 5000, engagement by 300%, and leads by 50%"  
  
↳ Write: "One post. 5000 new followers. Here's how:"  
  
(It shifts focus to a single, powerful stat)  
  
Remember:  
  
↳ In ghostwriting, data doesn't persuade.  
↳ Stories do.
