[Motivation for Importing your Kindle Highlights](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastiankamilli_i-sat-on-53000-unused-book-highlights-activity-7219219314942316545-LOaj?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop)

I recommend to install the plugin: [obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-kindle-plugin](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-kindle-plugin)

→ Connect with your Kindle
→ Import your book highlights

And then use that for inspiration for your content.
