# Profile Optimization Checklist

• Is your profile picture HQ?
• Is your profile picture close up?
• Do you have a banner?
• Do you have an optimised headline?
• Do you have over 500+ connections?
• Is your about section telling a story?
• Is your featured section optimised?
• Is your creator mode ON?   (I guess this now on by default)
• Do you have skills endorsed?
