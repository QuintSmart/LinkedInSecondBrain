So, what actually matters?  
  
+ Emotional resonance.  
+ Human connection.  
+ Standing out.  
  
  
## Emotional resonance:  
↳ Share your authentic story.  
↳ Celebrate your wins (and others')  
↳ Be vulnerable about your struggles.  
  
## Human connection:  
↳ Build real relationships.  
↳ Show genuine interest in others.  
↳ Engage in meaningful conversations.  
  
## Standing out:  
↳ Challenge the status quo.  
↳ Provide unexpected value.  
↳ Have a unique perspective.
