# The Experiment and PACT

## Current situation
After 6 months posting every day engagement with my posts did not increase that heavy. In the [[12 weeks LinkedIn mastery course]] I learned about the importance of engagement. And I want to experience that for my LinkedIn engagement too.

Posts had on average 3-10 reactions, 0-3 comments and 100-500 impressions.

## Research questions
How much does the recommended engagement strategy influence my posts engagement, connections and followers. Followers increase by 1% in 7 days (40 in a week).

I consider that a successful experiment when:
+ Reactions increase to 10 per post in 5 days in a row
+ Comments increase to 3+ per post in 5 days in a row
+ Followers increase to 100+ per week
+ Impressions increase to 4000+ per 7 days
+ I derive 10 Dm conversation calls
