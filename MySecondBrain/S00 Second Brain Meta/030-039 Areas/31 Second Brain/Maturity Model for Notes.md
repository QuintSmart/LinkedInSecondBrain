# Maturity Model for my Obsidian Notes
Based on the [great input from Nitin Pai](https://notes.nitinpai.in/Colophon/Bean)

# Epistemic status
"how much I think I know" about something.

+ First, we know things with different levels of certainty.
+ Second, what we think we are certain about itself varies in accuracy.
+ Third, facts change over time.

Notes fall into these levels: nut 🌰 → seedling 🌱 → potted plant 🪴 → tree 🌳 → ancient tree 🍁 → fallen leaf 🍂

# Current maturity model
Order is:
+ Nut 🌰
+ Seedling 🌱
+ Potted plant🪴
+ Tree 🌳
+ Ancient 🍁
+ Fallen leaf 🍂

## Nut 🌰
#epstatus/0-🌰
Initial question, thought, idea. Should be a fleeting note or early stage literature note, like a just captured book note.

Something that came to mind but has not been developed. 

## Seedling 🌱
#epstatus/1-🌱
A note is "seedling" 🌱 when I have started working on it, but do not think it is ready for sampling. Likely this is a fleeting note. It can also be a permanent note that I just extracted from a literature note.

Or a literature note where I did a first stage processing.

It could be factually wrong, inaccurate, misleading, a dead end, a red herring, a wild-goose or worse, the germ of a brilliant idea that will change the Universe forever. Who knows?

## Potted plant 🪴
#epstatus/2-🪴
A note is a "potted plant" 🪴 when I have worked on it for a while and think it is already in a mature state so that building on top of that is valuable. So you can consume it with greater confidence. 

## Tree 🌳
#epstatus/3-🌳
A note is a "tree" 🌳 when I think it has reached a high maturity state. So you can consume it with high confidence. 

## Ancient Tree 🍁
#epstatus/4-🍁
A note is an "ancient tree " 🍁 when knowledge becomes outdated and I might need to rethink original thought. 

## Fallen leaf 🍂
#epstatus/5-🍂
An note is a "fallen leaf" 🍂 when it is not longer valid or not useful. I will not likely not put further love to it. At the same time I'm not yet fully convinced to remove it entirely. It can still be linked.
