# ObsidianSecondBrain
Thanks for downloading your starter kit for Building your Second Brain with Obsidian. 

The folder **MySecondBrain** contains a fully configured Obsidian vault that provides a foundation for growing your Second Brain. 

To get started, you need to have [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) installed. And then open the Obsidian vault from the folder MySecondBrain. 

In your vault you find the welcome note *Start Here* and you're ready to grow your Second Brain.

I wish you a great learning journey and I'm looking forward to hear from you.
