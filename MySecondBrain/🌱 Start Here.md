# üå± Start Here

Welcome to your journey to discover and grow your Second Brain üß†

## What is a Second Brain?
You may ask - what is actually a Second Brain? Very short answer:

> [!summary] What is a Second Brain
> A repeatable, reliable system for generating ideas, gathering and organizing them, and putting them to use in concrete form


And to not replicate the great work that Tiago Forte did, please follow [this detailed learning path](https://digital-garden.ontheagilepath.net/moc-building-a-2nd-brain).

## Why are we using Obsidian?
Obsidian is a great tool where you can grow your Second Brain. So it makes sense to use a strong technical foundation to grow your Second Brain and make it useable for many cases and for a long term. 


## Where should I start now?
üè° [[Home]]  is great place to start. Explore from there. To understand the structure applied overall I recommend to get the basic idea for knowledge processing in a Second Brain. 

Please notice the acronym CODE - Capture-Organize-Distill-Express [^1]. 

1) First you **capture** information (C)
2) Then you **organize** information (O)
3) Followed by **distilling** the key aspects of the information and converting it to knowledge (D)
4) And use that knowledge to **express** your thought and apply it (E)

Before I explain CODE in more detail I recommend to use the [[Getting Started Guide overview]]  to practically experience build your Second Brain. 

## Capture
Start with adding your information. Start simple and add one by one. No need to move all information immediately. Take a small step, learn how that works and then take the next step. 

The basic building blocks inside Obsidian are *Notes*. And you can add notes in folders. 

These 4 approaches I regularly use to capture information:
+ I directly create a new note and write my thoughts in that note. And you can just easily paste images, pdfs, other formats. 
+ My Amazon Kindle is directly connected with Obsidian (see [[Currently used Plugins in an overview#Kindle Highlights]])
+ I use Matter as read later app to mark items in the Web that I want to read later. Matter is directly synced with my Obsidian
+ I maintain my Daily Journal. Just click on the calendar day (right top) and you can start adding a daily note

## Organize
The underlying organising principle is based on PARA [^2] which stands for Projects - Areas of Responsibility - Resources - Archives and is core to Building a Second Brain. 

I extended PARA to add Spaces on top. Spaces are used to differentiate several high level contexts. 

### Starting with Spaces
Your spaces are the top level entry points to your second brain. Inside spaces PARA is applied.

At the beginning there are three core spaces.

#### S00 Second Brain Meta
[[S00 Second Brain Meta]] contains meta level information about your Second Brain. It contains descriptions about:
+ the folders structure and approach behind described in [[The Folder Structure explained]]
+ an high level description for Building a Second Brain
+ [[JohnnyDecimalNumberings]] as an index for your project numbering
+ [[Currently used Plugins in an overview]]

#### S01 Personal 
[[S01 Personal]] provides the foundation for all knowledge in your Second Brain that is private to you. In my Second Brain I collect e.g. all my Kindle Highlights, Matter highlights, Personal projects and learnings across many domains I'm interested in. 

I separated that space from my workplace context to differentiate and e.g. enable an easier sharing of topics in my Digital Garden without running into problems of sharing company sensitive information.

#### S02 Your Workplace
[[S02 Your Workplace]] is a placeholder for a potential Second Brain space that belong to your workplace. I'm e.g. employed and I grow my Second Brain in many aspects of my professional career that is directly connected with my employment. 
Information about specific company aspects e.g. company vision, values but also my areas of responsibilities and my projects in that company belong to that space.

As of writing this chapter I'm happy to work for Blinkist. So in my setup this space is called S02 Blinkist.

### PARA in each space
In each space you find a folder for:
+ Projects
+ Areas
+ Resources
+ Utilities
+ Journal

[[The Folder Structure explained]]

## Distill
When you distill your notes, you extract key insights from information and connect it with your existing knowledge. The rich linking features that Obsidian offers are a great way to connect/link an information to existing knowledge. 

The small Obsidian Graph (see right bottom) shows you with what further items your current note is already connected. 

The better you connect information with existing knowledge the better new knowledge sticks and can be remembered/found later.

Once you mastered your fist steps in Obsidian I recommend to explore advanced concepts like:
+ [Progressive Summarization](https://digital-garden.ontheagilepath.net/progressive-summarization)
+ [[How to Take Smart Notes - S√∂nke Ahrens]]

Your Second brain is already prepared to work with a [[S01 Personal/030-039 Areas/32 Zettelkasten/32 Zettelkasten| Zettelkasten]] and the concept of [[S01 Personal/030-039 Areas/32 Zettelkasten/Fleeting Notes/Fleeting Notes| Fleeting Notes]] and [[S01 Personal/030-039 Areas/32 Zettelkasten/Permanent Notes/Permanent Notes| Permanent Notes]] . 

## Express
To express your thoughts there are many possibilities that can all be started right from your Second Brain. Some approaches that I use:
+ Working out loud in a Blog or [Digital Garden](https://digital-garden.ontheagilepath.net/)
+ Export information from your Second Brain for example simply as Pdfs or a combined version created with [[Currently used Plugins in an overview#Longform]]
+ Create visuals directly in Obsidian using Excalidraw [[Currently used Plugins in an overview#Excalidraw]]

I created workshops within hours just based on my previously distilled notes. Once you reach that level you can fully leverage your Second Brain

## Closing
I wish you a great experience with Discovering, Building and then Peeking your Second Brain. And following [[Atomic Habits - James Clear]], build on small steps, repeat them and earn your rewards. Day-by-day, Note-by-Note üöÄüß†.
